    (Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and)
    (groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner.)
    (Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic)
    (contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other.)
    (Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted)
    (packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly)
    (perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far)
    (more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments)
    (will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control)
    (economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the)
    (nature of trust and reputation.)
